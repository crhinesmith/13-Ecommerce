  ## Description 
  This project was completed via configuring a working Express.js API to use Sequelize to interact with a MySQL database. After sourcing the MySQL schema, seeding the database, then starting the server, the user is able to make a variety of API calls to Create, Read, Update, and Delete the data within the database.
